Shield circuit for an Arduino based mini weather station. It can measure temperature, air pressure, humidity, and show them on 5110 LCD screen. Also, it is developed to measure Altitude.

Just upgraded my useful homemade handheld mini air station to make it more useful with some more capabilities. Now you can read texts, check the temperature, humidity, air pressure, altitude, and control servos or components.
